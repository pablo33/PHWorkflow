# PHotodeliver


Script for automatic image's metadatation of image files stored in an informed folder tree structure .

This script injects the date of the image-take by selecting the most appropriate image's date-taken on own EXIF metadata , text that forms the path of the image, or the creation date of the file ( STAT). This data is later injected as EXIF metadata.

It also sets the files in a new hierarchic directory tree based on the metadata.

Ideal for reporting EXIF data on old family photographs.

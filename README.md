# PHotodeliver


Script for automatic image metadatation and grouping by date.

- Group image files by date.
- Inserts image's date metadata by retrieving it from the path/filename, or by the file-creation date.
- Convert png files into jpg.

I use it to metadate for my old family photographs stored in folders whose date is stored as part of its path.


Dependencies:
needs at least ubuntu 14.04
python3-pil  #  For image conversion
